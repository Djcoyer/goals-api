To run, you must have MongoDB installed locally and running on port 27017. The command to run the MongoDB service is mongod.exe inside your terminal once Mongo is installed globally. For more information, visit: [this site](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows)

Once these are all in place, run the application which is hosted on port 8081. The UI for this project can be located [here](https://github.com/Djcoyer/goals-ui)
